# Titanium Clone Mode — ported from the "Most Powerful Src Bot" project's
# Akbots/titanium.py, trimmed down to fit Diskwala bot's single-file
# architecture.
#
# What it does:
#   Lets a user connect their own @BotFather bot token. The token gets a
#   real, running pyrogram Client of its own ("the clone"), which is
#   wired up with the EXACT SAME link_handler/callback_handler functions
#   main.py already uses for downloads — so the clone can fetch/stream
#   Diskwala links exactly like the main bot, just on its own bot
#   token/flood-limit pool instead of sharing the main bot's with every
#   other user.
#
# How "owner-only" is enforced:
#   _register_owner_gate() adds one filter-less handler, in a group
#   number (OWNER_GATE_GROUP) lower than every other handler registered
#   on the clone. It runs before anything else on every message/callback
#   the clone receives:
#     - sender is the owner -> raise ContinuePropagation, so pyrogram
#       moves on to the real handlers exactly as normal.
#     - anyone else          -> return with no reply, so nothing else on
#       the clone ever runs for them.
#   This is the entire safety boundary — one handler at the front of the
#   queue, not a per-handler audit.
#
# Two ways to connect a clone bot:
#   1. Manual (/addbot <token>) — paste a @BotFather token directly.
#   2. Auto-create (Bot API 9.6 "Managed Bots", added April 2026) — tap a
#      button, Telegram shows a native "Create Bot?" dialog with a
#      pre-filled name/username, tap Create, done. See
#      _titanium_autocreate_cb / _handle_managed_bot_created below for how
#      this is wired. REQUIRES a one-time manual setup step this code
#      can't do for you: open @BotFather's Mini App → enable "Bot
#      Management Mode" for this bot. Needs a recent kurigram build with
#      the April-2026 TL additions generated — see _managed_bots_available()
#      below; on an older build this just falls back to /addbot only.
#
# Managed-bot token revocation (reference's _revoke_managed_bot_token,
# Bot API 9.6 replaceManagedBotToken) — ported and wired into two spots:
#   1. Remove-cleanup — /delbot and the ❌ Remove button both revoke a
#      "managed" (Auto-Create) bot's token with Telegram before wiping it
#      from storage, so a removed clone's token can't keep working
#      elsewhere. Manual (/addbot) bots skip this — this bot has no API
#      access to revoke a @BotFather-issued token, only /revoke on
#      BotFather itself does that.
#   2. Auto token-rotation — a 🔄 Rotate Token button (bot-details view,
#      managed bots only) that revokes the current token AND gets a
#      fresh one back in the SAME Telegram call, verifies it, swaps the
#      stored entry and restarts the clone. No manual @BotFather paste
#      needed, unlike a manual bot (which has no equivalent here — just
#      /delbot then /addbot with a new token).
#
# What was intentionally left out (vs. the reference implementation):
#   - A full admin/settings menu on the clone — the clone's whole point
#     is personal downloading, so it only gets /start plus the same
#     download/stream/cancel handlers as the main bot.
#   - The reference's purpose="custom_bot" branch / _AUTOCREATE_PURPOSE
#     dict — that's for Akbots' separate "My Bots → Add Auto Bot" plain
#     forwarding-bot feature, which this project doesn't have. Every
#     auto-created bot here becomes a Titanium clone, full stop.
#   - get_job_client()'s flood-pool auto-selection (main bot picking a
#     clone for a forward job) — Akbots-specific concept for its
#     multi-chat forward jobs; doesn't apply to Diskwala's link-download
#     model, where the clone is only ever used directly by its owner.

    command, every menu button, every inline callback — matching the
    reference project's `plugins=dict(root="Akbots")` approach (which
    loads the exact same plugin package on the clone as the main bot).

    This project has no separate plugin package to reload — everything
    lives in one main.py — so the equivalent here is copying the already-
    registered handler *objects* straight from app.dispatcher.groups.
    Pyrogram handler objects are just callback+filter wrappers with no
    state tying them to a specific Client, so they're safe to reuse
    across multiple Clients this way.

    Groups < 0 are skipped — those are this project's own internal
    plumbing on the main app (e.g. the -5 /addbot token-catch handlers,
    which are meaningless on a clone since Titanium itself isn't
    re-offered inside a clone) and are handled separately/explicitly
    where a clone-specific version is actually wanted (see the -1
    /start & /cancel overrides right below this function's call site).
    RawUpdateHandlers (e.g. the managed-bot-creation listener) are
    likewise not copied — a clone doesn't need to be able to create
    further clones of itself.

    The main app's OWN /start and /cancel handlers (registered at the
    default group 0, same as everything else) are also explicitly
    skipped here — even though group -1 already registers clone-specific
    overrides for exactly these two commands, relying on "group -1 runs
    first so it wins" was not actually enough to stop the group-0 copy
    from *also* firing on every /start (users were seeing two replies:
    the clone's own welcome message, plus the main bot's start message
    copied verbatim). Skipping the copy outright removes the duplicate
